# Projects Portfolio
This repository presents a collection of projects showcasing my experience and GIS skillsets
## Coseismic Landslide Probability Modeling
For my master's capstone project, I estimated coseismic landslide probability for an M9 Cascadia Subduction Zone Earthquake in the Lower Bogachiel River Valley near Forks, WA. I calculated coseismic landslide probability based on [30 earthquake scenarios](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/bssa/article-abstract/108/5A/2347/544772/Broadband-Synthetic-Seismograms-for-Magnitude-9?redirectedFrom=fulltext) and a [USGS empirical model](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2017JF004494). 

Skill Highlights:

- Wrote Python scripts for calculating coseismic landslide probability
- Analyzed overlap between coseismic landslide probability models in QGIS
- Created a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/brekc/Coseismic-Landslide-Probability-for-an-M9-CSZ-Earthquake-in-the-Lower-Bogachiel-River-Valley-WA) to preserve Python code and input datasets for reproducing project work 

## Field Research at Undi Rd near Forks, WA
While attending graduate school in the Masterâ€™s in Applied Geosciences program at the University of Washington, I collected field observations with members of my cohort at Undi Rd near Forks, WA. I also had the opportunity to assist with GIS-related needs for course projects and additional research in the Lower Bogachiel River Valley.           

Skill Highlights:

- Created timelapse series of the Bogachiel River and active Undi Rd landslide with the Google Earth Engine Python API
- Designed digital field maps with ArcGIS for data collection in Avenza Maps
- Assisted cohort members and advisors in other applied geoscience projects


## Seismic Station Mapping
Skill Highlights:

- Developed methods for updating geodatabases and station maps with ArcGIS and Python
- Designed ArcMap templates to produce physical and digital maps with complex symbology
- Worked with field engineers and research seismologists to create report maps

## Surveying at Discovery Park in Seattle, WA
Skill Highlights:

- Collected and processed LiDAR data of the Magnolia Bluff with Riegl RiSCAN Pro
- Conducted a sUAS survey of Discovery Park and produced a structure from motion model with Pix4D
- Visualized and analyzed point cloud datasets in CloudCompare
